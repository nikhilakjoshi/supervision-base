1. Make the table take up the full width available.
2. Instead of adding the `container` or `max-width` class at the top level, add 36px (or rem equivalent) padding on left and right
3. Use the following colors for the badges:
   - PENDING REVIEW - background (#f4f7fa) with Dark text (#3a4752)
   - REVIEW IN PROGRESS - background (#ffe0ce) with Dark amber text (#914503)
   - REVIEWED - Green background (#d4fce7) with Dark Green text (#0b6535)
     Check to see if colors can be leveraged for already included theme. For un-configured colors, setup custom colors in tailwind.
4. The header row of the table should have a light blue backgound (#eaf7ff)
