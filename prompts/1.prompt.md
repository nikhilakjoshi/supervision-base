1. I have setup a new nextjs project with tailwindcss and shadcn/ui.
2. Setup a basePath of `/supervision` in the config.
3. I have install ag-grid. in the base route, setup a simple ag-grid-react table with the following UI Design:
   - Header with title "List of Calls"
   - Below the header, a row mean for a data range filter (use shadcn's components) and a `Clear Filters` button.
   - The table will have the following columns:
     - No.
     - Interaction ID
     - Agent Name
     - Call Type (Inbound, Outbound)
     - Interaction Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
     - Origin
     - Status - (PENDING REVIEW, REVIEW IN PROGRESS, REVIEWED) - use badges for this.
     - Actions - View Call button (use shadcn's button component)
   - Add 5 rows of sample data to the table.
